# python-messenger

A secure messaging application built with python
```
Version : 1.0
Author : Subham Mohapatra
```


This messenger is built to enable the clients to exchange text messages. The clients connect to a server (hosted on cloud) and they will be able to securely exchange messages with each other through the server.

The encryption features for this messenger are : 
1. All the messages exchanged between the client and server are encrypted with RSA algorithm (using pycrypto module)
2. Digital signatures are included to check the authenticity of any received message (also by using pycrypto module)

###### Note : Though this application enables secure transmission of messages, it may still be vulnerable to sql injection attacks, you can make simple modifications in the code to avoid these attacks. Any found vulnerability will be fixed in the next versions.


# Installation Guide
I tried to bundle all the required modules into a requirements.txt but I failed because some modules need some special attention to be installed on your computer, and they also depend on the OS you're using. So please don't hate me.
